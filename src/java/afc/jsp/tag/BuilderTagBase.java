/**
 * <p>An abstract simple tag whose sub-classes produce a sequence of events which can be handled
 * by event handlers to render a complex structure by small pieces. Event handlers are
 * the {@link EventTag &lt;event&gt;} tags in the {@code <builder>} tag body. The {@code name}
 * attribute of the {@code event} tag defines the event this tag subscribes to. The algorithmic
 * part of the rendering process is implemented by the {@link #build()} function. Each time an event
 * is raised by {@code <builder>} (see {@link #raiseEvent(String)}) the correspondent
 * {@code <event>} tag body is evaluated. All parameters to the event handler (if any) are passed
 * in the JSP context.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The advantage of this approach to render content is clear separation between code that
 * generates structure (it is enclosed in the tag's {@code build()} function) and code that renders
 * output (it is enclosed in event handler tags' bodies). This allows for having simple and
 * straightforward JSP code while keeping all algorithmic complexity in Java code (which is easier
 * to create, test, and document). In addition, it is possible to implement different representations
 * on top of the same algorithm.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An example below demonstrates a simple use case of the {@code <builder>}/{@code <event>} tags.</p>
 * <h2>Example.</h2>
 * <h3>The builder tag.</h3>
 * <pre>{@literal
 * public class DigitsTag extends BuilderTagBase
 * { 
 *   protected void build() throws IOException, JspException
 *   {
 *     raiseEvent("start");
 *     for (int i = 0; i &amp; 10; ++i) {
 *       if (i != 0) {
 *         raiseEvent("separator");
 *       }
 *       getJspContext().setAttribute("digit", i);
 *       raiseEvent("digit");
 *     }
 *     raiseEvent("end");
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>JSP fragment.</h3>
 * <pre>{@literal
 * <afc:digits>
 *   <afc:event name="start">digits: [</afc:event>
 *   <afc:event name="end">];</afc:event>
 *   <afc:event name="digit">${digit}</afc:event>
 *   <afc:event name="separator"> </afc:event>
 * </afc:digits>}</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>JSP output.</h3>
 * <pre>{@literal digits: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9];}</pre>
 * 
 * <p>In this example the JSP code has neither loops nor branches.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Additional details.</h2>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@code <builder>}'s body is evaluated once and before {@code build()} is invoked. The content
 *      generated while evaluating the body is omitted.</li>
 *  <li>It is allowed to have no body for the {@code <builder>} tag. The {@code build()} function
 *      is invoked in this case while having no output rendered.</li>
 *  <li>If an exception is thrown while evaluating {@code <builder>}'s body then {@code build()}
 *      is not invoked.</li>
 *  <li>{@code <event>} tags could be direct or indirect inner tags of the {@code <builder>} tag
 *      to be registered as event handlers.</li>
 *  <li>Only a single event handler could be registered to listen for a given event.</li>
 *  <li>It is allowed to have no event handler for an event. In this case the events are ignored
 *      with no error. Event handler tags with empty bodies have the same effect.</li>
 * </ul>
